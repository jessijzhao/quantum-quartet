- take out the ownership indicator from the card class itself
- add card ids??? there are always FAMILYSIZE * PLAYERS cards
  -> probably inefficient

how about hand being a library without owners? no need for cards then
    # how about hand as above and cards having set owners????
    though it makes sense to group by family and then have the values within

ANYWAY LOOKS LIKE MAJOR RESTRUCTURING SO NO NEED TO CONTINUE FIXING THINGS FOR NOW
