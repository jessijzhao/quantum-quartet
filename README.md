# quantum-quartet (WIP)

Helper tool for card game "Quantenquartett" (German, "quantum quartet")

Given complete history of actions, will tell players when game ending conditions (i.e. paradox or win) occur.

The actual purpose of this small project is to find a fitting representation of the game state to prepare for creating a visualization.

## Running the game
Simply run `python quartet`. For rules to the game see [here](rules.txt).

## Prerequisites
Requires Python 3.x.
