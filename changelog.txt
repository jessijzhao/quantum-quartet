TODO:
- take out the ownership indicator from the card class itself
- add card ids??? there are always FAMILYSIZE * PLAYERS cards
  -> probably inefficient

how about hand being a library without owners? no need for cards then
    # how about hand as above and cards having set owners????
    though it makes sense to group by family and then have the values within
  also how about {family: value} as cards??, e.g. {"fruits": "apple"}


Changes in 0.1:
- added changelog (included todos from ideas)
- updated to non-working version of classes.py and quartet.py
- updated README
